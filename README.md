# Urdu Poetry Generation 
## Project Description:
This project aims to generate Urdu poetry using N-Grams based on a scrapped poetry dataset. The dataset contains a collection of Urdu poems from various **Urdu Poets**, serving as the foundation for training and generating new poetic verses. 
The project will explore the use of the following different N-Gram models:
1. **Unigram**
2. **Bigram** 
3. **Trigram**
4. **Backward Bigram**
5. **Bi-directional Bigram**
## Data Collection:
The dataset has been scrapped from the following website : https://www.rekhta.org/ . All poems of atleast 25 Urdu Poets have been scrapped from this website.
**Scrappy** has been used to achieve the web-scrapping task . Following is the link for **Scrappy** : https://scrapy.org/
The scrapped data has been saved in the **scrapped poems.csv**.
## Scrapped_Poems.csv:
The csv file contains the following 3 columns :
1. Poem Line : This is the verse in a particular poem
2. Nazm Name : This is the name of the poem
3. Author Name : This is the name of the author of the poem
## Conclusion: 
Through this project, I aim to showcase the versatility and creativity of N-Gram models in generating Urdu poetry while preserving the aesthetic and linguistic richness of the language.
