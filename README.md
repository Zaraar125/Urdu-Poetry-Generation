# Urdu Poetry Generation 
## Project Description:
This project aims to generate Urdu poetry using N-Grams based on a scrapped poetry dataset. The dataset contains a collection of Urdu poems from various **Urdu Poets**, serving as the foundation for training and generating new poetic verses. 
The project will explore the use of the following different N-Gram models:
1. **Unigram**
2. **Bigram** 
3. **Trigram**
4. **Backward Bigram**
5. **Bi-directional Bigram**
## Data Collection:
The dataset has been scrapped from the following website : https://www.rekhta.org/ . All poems of atleast 25 Urdu Poets have been scrapped from this website.
**Scrappy** has been used to achieve the web-scrapping task . Following is the link for **Scrappy** : https://scrapy.org/
The scrapped data has been saved in the **scrapped poems.csv**.
## Conclusion: 
Through this project, I aim to showcase the versatility and creativity of N-Gram models in generating Urdu poetry while preserving the aesthetic and linguistic richness of the language.
