# Urdu Poetry Generation 
## Project Description
This project aims to generate Urdu poetry using N-Grams based on a scrapped poetry dataset. The dataset contains a collection of Urdu poems from various **Urdu Poets**, serving as the foundation for training and generating new poetic verses. 
The project will explore the use of the following different N-Gram models:
1. **Unigram**
2. **Bigram** 
3. **Trigram**
4. **Backward Bigram**
5. **Bi-directional Bigram**
Through this project, I aim to showcase the versatility and creativity of N-Gram models in generating Urdu poetry while preserving the aesthetic and linguistic richness of the language.
