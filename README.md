# Urdu Poetry Generation 
## Project Description
This project aims to generate Urdu poetry using N-Grams based on a curated poetry dataset. The dataset contains a collection of Urdu poems from various poets, serving as the foundation for training and generating new poetic verses. 
The project will explore the use of different N-Gram models, including Unigram, Bigram, Trigram, Backward Bigram, and Bi-directional Bigram models, to capture the essence and structure of Urdu poetry.
The Unigram model will focus on individual words, capturing their frequencies and probabilities of occurrence within the dataset. This model will provide a baseline understanding of the vocabulary and word choices typical in Urdu poetry.
The Bigram model will extend this by considering pairs of consecutive words, allowing for the creation of more contextually relevant poetic lines. By analyzing word pairs, the model can generate verses that maintain a higher level of coherence and semantic flow.
The Trigram model will further enhance the generation process by incorporating sequences of three words. This model will capture deeper linguistic patterns and dependencies, leading to the creation of more intricate and nuanced poetic expressions.
The Backward Bigram model will explore the reverse order of word pairs, offering an alternative perspective on sentence structures and poetic compositions. This approach can lead to the generation of unique and unconventional poetry styles.
Lastly, the Bi-directional Bigram model will combine both forward and backward word pair analyses, leveraging bidirectional context to generate rich and diverse poetic outputs. 
By considering both directions, this model can produce verses that exhibit a blend of traditional and innovative poetic elements.
Through this project, we aim to showcase the versatility and creativity of N-Gram models in generating Urdu poetry while preserving the aesthetic and linguistic richness of the language. 
The generated poems will be evaluated based on metrics such as coherence, relevance, and poetic quality, providing insights into the effectiveness of each N-Gram model in capturing the essence of Urdu literary tradition.
